Image analysis: Reorganizing and sorting image files and creating CellPose mask

Four types of images were acquired from 384-well plates using high-content imaging across four different channels.
Fluorescence images for nuclei and phase-contrast images were used to segment the cytoplasm of individual cells.
The CellPose segmentation algorithm was optimized and applied to the acquired images.
Prior to processing, image files were reorganized and sorted, and new folders were created to store the CellPose-generated masks separately.
